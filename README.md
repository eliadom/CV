 Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she expected to find in your project? 
The final user is a business looking for the skills I can offer to their company. This CV is not interactive but it does have some interactive elements that may stand out over a completely static one. 

 Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis isn’t very relevant.
I made it so the first thing you’d see when opening this CV website, is some basic information about me, that’s name, pictures, and some illustrations on what my hobbies are. Further on there’s personal information, language aptitudes and experience on programming languages as well as formation and work experience.
 Visual design: which color palette will you use? Which typography? Which page layout? Look for inspirational similar projects
 
From the very beginning I was sure I wanted a colour palette that would look rather inviting, but not too much, so formality would never be lost. Colour psychology was used in this project; the main colour I chose was a mix between dark blue and purple, blue meaning loyalty and security, while purple would represent respect and independence.
Along with that, a 3 colour palette was chosen using Coolors. A soft orange was created to convey cozyness.
